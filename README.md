# Hands-on with Tauri & Yew

This is the code accompanying the Rust Nation 2023 hands-on workshop. 

## Prerequisites

1. Install the wasm32 Rust target

```
rustup target install wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

2. Install the Tauri CLI

```
cargo install tauri-cli
```

3. Install Trunk

cargo install trunk

4. Clone this repo

git clone https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/rustnation23-workshop

## Structure

This repo contains a handful or numbered snapshots (1 through 4) in the `./checkpoints` subfolder that correspond to the numbered stages on the slides. You can check out any of these to time-travel or skip ahead. 

There is also a `complete` checkpoint which is my take on the RSS-reader app shown at the beginning of the talk.
